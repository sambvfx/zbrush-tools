# zbrush-tools
Misc ZBrush tools focused on dealing with large assets with many SubTools.

Installation
------------
Drop the `DefaultZScript.txt` and the `luma` folder in your install directory ./ZScripts folder. For easier script management, you may also put the `luma` folder somewhere else in your filesystem and create a symlink `luma` in the ZScripts folder instead.
